    "\n",
    "You're trying to automate your alarm clock by writing a function for it. You're given a day of the week encoded as *1=Mon, 2=Tue, ... 6=Sat, 7=Sun*, and whether you are on **vacation** as a boolean value (a boolean object is either True or False. Google \"booleans python\" to get a better understanding). Based on the day and whether you're on **vacation**, write a function that returns a time in form of a string indicating when the alarm clock should ring. \n",
    "\n",
    "When not on a **vacation**, on **weekdays**, the alarm should ring at *\"7:00\"* and on the **weekends** (Saturday and Sunday) it should ring at *\"10:00\"*. \n",
    "\n",
    "While on a **vacation**, it should ring at *\"10:00\"* on **weekdays**. On **vacation**, it should not ring on **weekends**, that is, it should return *\"off\"*.\n"
