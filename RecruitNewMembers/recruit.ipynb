    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a manager as a big firm and now are looking for new members for your team. You sent out an advertisement and have received a few applications. You have a habit of scoring people on a scale of 100. You have given scores to all the members of your team and the new applications. The process of selection is going to be very straightforward if the applicant improves the average of the team then you hire the applicant to join the team or else reject the application. Remember the order of processing applications is going to be important here.\n",
